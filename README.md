# Self Driving Car
 This project is created using neural network and JavaScript with no libraries. In this Project you will learn to make a self-driving car simulation by implementing every component step-by-step. You will learn how to implement the car driving mechanics, how to define the environment, how to simulate some sensors, how to detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using a neural network.

In this project the Self Driving car controls itself by learning every time by its own, and you can also save the best path and best car by saving(button).The Car will remeber the saved decision and will also learn each time it drives.

You can add to decrease the trafffic as per your requirement, more traffic will help the car to be more accurate and will train the car to be more precise.

Thank You!!
